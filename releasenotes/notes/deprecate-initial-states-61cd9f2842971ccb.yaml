features:
  - |
    The ``HartreeFock`` and ``VSCF`` initial state components are now circuits, 
    so they provide all methods and flexibility of the ``QuantumCircuit`` object.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``InitialState`` object and derived classes, as well as the ``VarFormBased``
    class, have been deprecated. Instead, the ``QuantumCircuit`` can be used.
    The individual classes emit deprecation warnings on how they can be replaced, 
    but here is a short overview.

    .. code-block::

        InitialState component | How to replace
        -----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------
        Zero                   | an empty QuantumCircuit
        Custom(circuit)        | use the circuit directly as input 
        Custom(state_vector)   | qc = QuantumCircuit(n) 
                               | qc.initialize(state_vector, qc.qubits)  # normalize vector! 
        Custom('random')       | use the initialize instruction with random amplitudes 
        VarFormBased           | use the circuit of the variational form directly 
        HartreeFock            | has been replaced in-place, can still use this class
        VSCF                   | has been replaced in-place, can still use this class
