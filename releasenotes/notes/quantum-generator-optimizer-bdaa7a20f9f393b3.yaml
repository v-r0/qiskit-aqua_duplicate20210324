    Added getters and setters for the seed, optimizer, and discriminator
    properties of the `QuantumGenerator` class. Prior to this, we needed
    to either change the generator, or access a protected member 
    (QuantumGenerator._optimizer) of the QuantumGenerator class in order
    to change the generator optimizer.
