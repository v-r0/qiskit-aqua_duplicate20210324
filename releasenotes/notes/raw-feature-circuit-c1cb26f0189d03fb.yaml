features:
  - |
    Add the :class:`~qiskit.ml.circuit.library.RawFeatureVector` class to 
    allow encoding data points directly as qubit amplitudes, analogous to the now
    deprecated :class:`~qiskit.aqua.components.feature_maps.RawFeatureVector`.
deprecations:
  - |
    Deprecated :class:`~qiskit.aqua.components.feature_maps.RawFeatureVector` 
    in favor of :class:`~qiskit.ml.circuit.library.RawFeatureVector`. Further,
    :class:`~qiskit.aqua.circuits.StateVectorCircuit` has been deprecated, since 
    instead the `isometry` and `initialize` of the `QuantumCircuit` can 
    be used.
