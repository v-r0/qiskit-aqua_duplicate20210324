    Added :class:`~qiskit.aqua.operators.PauliSumOp`, which is a new subclass of
    :class:`~qiskit.aqua.operators.PrimitiveOp`. ``SummedOp[PauliOp]`` is replaced
    with ``PauliSumOp`` when it is not nested and coefficients are not
    ``ParameterExpression``. For example, ``X + Y`` becomes ``PauliSumOp``.
    PauliSumOp improves the performance of basic arithmetic operations, reduce,
    eqality check, to_matrix, etc.
