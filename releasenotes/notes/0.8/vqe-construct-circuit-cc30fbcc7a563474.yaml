    The ``construct_circuit`` method of ``VQE`` previously returned the 
    expectation value to be evaluated as type ``OperatorBase``.
    This functionality has been moved into ``construct_expectation`` and 
    ``construct_circuit`` returns a list of the circuits that are evaluated
    to compute the expectation value.
