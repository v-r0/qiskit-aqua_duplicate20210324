    ``op.eval(other)``, where ``op`` is of type ``OperatorBase``, sometimes
    silently returns a nonsensical value when the number of qubits in ``op``
    and ``other`` are not equal. This fix results in correct behavior, which
    is to throw an error rather than return a value, because the input in
    this case is invalid.
