      An interface for excited states calculation has been added to the chemistry module.
      It is now easier for the user to create a general excited states calculation. 
      This calculation is based on a ``Driver`` which provides the relevant information 
      about the molecule, a ``Transformation`` which provides the information about the 
      mapping of the problem into a qubit Hamiltonian, and finally a Solver. 
      The Solver is the specific way which the excited states calculation is done 
      (the algorithm). This structure follows the one of the ground state calculations.    
      The results are modified to take lists of expectation values instead of a single one.
      The ``QEOM`` and ``NumpyEigensolver`` are adapted to the new structure. 
      A factory is introduced to run a numpy eigensolver with a specific filter 
      (to target states of specific symmetries).
