    The ``__hash__`` method of the ``PauliOp`` class used the ``id()`` method
    which prevents set comparisons to work as expected since they rely on hash
    tables and identical objects used to not have identical hashes. Now, the
    implementation uses a hash of the string representation inline with the
    implementation in the ``Pauli`` class.
