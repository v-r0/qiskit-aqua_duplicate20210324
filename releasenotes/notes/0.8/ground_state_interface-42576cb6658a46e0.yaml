features:
  - |
    Introduces ``transformations`` for the fermionic and bosonic transformation of a problem
    instance. Transforms the fermionic operator to qubit operator. Respective class for the
    transformation is ``fermionic_transformation``
    Introduces in algorithms ``ground_state_solvers`` for the calculation of ground state
    properties. The calculation can be done either using an ``MinimumEigensolver`` or using
    ``AdaptVQE``
    Introduces ``chemistry/results`` where the eigenstate_result and the
    electronic_structure_result are also used for the algorithms.
    Introduces Minimum Eigensolver factories ``minimum_eigensolver_factories`` where chemistry specific
    minimum eigensolvers can be initialized
    Introduces orbital optimization vqe ``oovqe`` as a ground state solver for chemistry applications
deprecations:
  - |
    ``Core Hamiltonian`` class is deprecated in favor of the ``FermionicTransformation``
    ``Chemistry Operator`` class is deprecated in favor of the ``tranformations``
    ``minimum_eigen_solvers/vqe_adapt`` is also deprecated and moved as an implementation
    of the ground_state_solver interface
    ``applications/molecular_ground_state_energy`` is deprecated in favor of ``ground_state_solver``
