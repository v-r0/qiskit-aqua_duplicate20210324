    Changed in python version 3.8: On macOS, the spawn start method is now the
    default. The fork start method should be considered unsafe as it can
    lead to crashes in subprocesses.
    However P_BFGS doesn't support spawn, so we revert to single process.
    Refer to
    `#1109 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/issues/1109>` for more details.
