    ``OptimizationResult.__init__`` did not check whether the sizes of ``x`` and
    ``variables`` match or not (they should match). This fix added the check to
    raise an error if they do not match and fixes bugs detected by the check.
    This fix also adds missing unit tests related to ``OptimizationResult.variable_names``
    and ``OptimizationResult.variables_dict`` in ``test_converters``.
