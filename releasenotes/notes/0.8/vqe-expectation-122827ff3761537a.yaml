    VQE expectation computation with Aer qasm_simulator now defaults to a
    computation that has the expected shot noise behavior. The special Aer
    snapshot based computation, that is much faster, with the ideal output
    similar to state vector simulator, may still be chosen but like before
    Aqua 0.7 it now no longer defaults to this but can be chosen.
