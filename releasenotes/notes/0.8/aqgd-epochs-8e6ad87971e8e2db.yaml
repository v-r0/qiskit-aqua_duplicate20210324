upgrade:
  - Extension of the previous Analytic Quantum Gradient Descent (AQGD) classical optimizer with the 
    AQGD with Epochs.
    Now AQGD performs the gradient descent optimization with a momentum term, analytic gradients,
    and an added customized step length schedule for parametrized quantum gates.
    Gradients are computed "analytically" using the quantum circuit when evaluating
    the objective function.
