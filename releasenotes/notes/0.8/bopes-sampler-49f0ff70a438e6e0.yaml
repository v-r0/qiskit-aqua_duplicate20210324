    A new algorithm has been added: the Born Openheimer Potential Energy surface for the 
    calculation of potential energy surface along different degrees of freedom of the molecule. 
    The algorithm is called ``BOPESSampler``. It further provides functionalities of fitting the 
    potential energy surface to an analytic function of predefined potentials.some details.
