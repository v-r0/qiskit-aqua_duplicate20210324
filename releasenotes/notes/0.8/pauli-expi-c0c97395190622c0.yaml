    Make PauliOp.exp_i() generate the correct matrix with the following changes.
    1) There was previously an error in the phase of a factor of 2.
    2) The global phase was ignored when converting the circuit
    to a matrix. We now use qiskit.quantum_info.Operator, which is
    generally useful for converting a circuit to a unitary matrix,
    when possible.
