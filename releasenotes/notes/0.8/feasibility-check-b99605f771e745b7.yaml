    A feasibility check of the obtained solution has been added to all optimizers in the
    optimization stack. This has been implemented by adding two new methods to ``QuadraticProgram``:
    * ``get_feasibility_info(self, x: Union[List[float], np.ndarray])`` accepts an array and returns
    whether this solution is feasible and a list of violated variables(violated bounds) and
    a list of violated constraints.
    * ``is_feasible(self, x: Union[List[float], np.ndarray])`` accepts an array and returns whether
    this solution is feasible or not.
