    Previously, SummedOp.to_matrix_op built a list MatrixOp's (with numpy
    matrices) and then summed them, returning a single MatrixOp. Some
    algorithms (for example vqe) require summing thousands of matrices, which
    exhausts memory when building the list of matrices. With this change,
    no list is constructed. Rather, each operand in the sum is converted to
    a matrix, added to an accumulator, and discarded.
