    The ``cvxpy <https://www.cvxpy.org/>`_ dependency which is required for
    the the svm classifier has been removed from the requirements list and made
    an optional dependency. This is because installing cvxpy is not seamless
    in every environment and often requires a compiler be installed to run.
    To use the svm classifier now you'll need to install cvxpy by either
    running ``pip install cvxpy<1.1.0`` or to install it with aqua running
    ``pip install qiskit-aqua[cvx]``.
