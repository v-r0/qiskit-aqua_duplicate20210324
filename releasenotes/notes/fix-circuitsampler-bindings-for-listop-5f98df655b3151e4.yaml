    Previously, if a parameterized ``ListOp`` was passed to the circuit sampler, along with 
    parameter bindings, all operators must have been parameterized by the same parameters. 
    This restriction has been lifted, such that e.g. 
    ``ListOp([contains parameter x, contains parameters x and y])`` can be passed.
    Further, the representation of the ``params`` argument to ``CircuitSampler.convert`` now 
    also allows ``{param: value}`` instead of requiring ``{param: [value]}`` for single 
    parameter bindings.
