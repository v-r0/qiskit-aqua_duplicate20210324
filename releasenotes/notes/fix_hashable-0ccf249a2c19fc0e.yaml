issues:
  - |
    PrimitiveOp had a `__hash__`, implementation but failed to always
    follow the Python hashable rule such that two equivalent objects
    had different hash values.
    See #1399 for details.
fixes:
  - |
    Since the underlying primitives are not hashable it is problematic to achieve
    and maintain the correct hashable behavior for the PrimitiveOps so
    `PrimitiveOp.__hash__` has been removed.
    `SummedOp.equals` was changed since it used the hash, via the set
    comparison mechanism, to now do a naive all-pair comparison.
