    Sort the parameters of the generator circuit by name to ensure result reproducibility.
    Previously, the parameters of the generator circuit were converted to a list using a 
    conversion from set to list. If this is repeated several times for the same circuit, 
    the order of parameters can be inconsistent, leading to inconsistent results since the 
    numerical optimizer updates the parameters in a different order.
