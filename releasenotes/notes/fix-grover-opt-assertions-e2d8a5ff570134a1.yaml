    The two's complement computation of ``v = Q(x)`` in the ``GroverOptimizer`` regularly raised 
    assertion errors since not enough bits were provided to the conversion. The two's complement 
    computation is in fact not necessary at all. The whole conversion has been removed along with
    the obsolete check of the first bit in `v`.
